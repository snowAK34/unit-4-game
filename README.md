# unit-4-game

## Description

This is a number matching game where the gem images are given random numbers and the user clicks the images to increase their score, trying to match the target without going over.

## Usage

This project was made to practice using jQuery, both for the click interaction with the gem images, and for the text display on winning or losing the game.

## Images

The crystal image used for the header and footer was found on Pexels and is a photo that was taken by Jonny Lew.

The gems were cropped from an image of gems on clipart.org that was done by user firestorm200.

## Roadmap

I would consider adding conditions that ensure all gems have different values.

The finished score could be added to the win/lose message to persist when the game resets.
